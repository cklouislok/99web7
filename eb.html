        <h3>Interactive and Intuitive Visualization of Neighborhood Point, Line and Polygon Data</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/eb_1_landingpage.png" alt="Experience Builder Landing Page">
        <p>ArcGIS Experience Builder provides a user-friendly and interactive solution to strtegically organizing multiple 
          thematic maps into a single, easily accessible hub. The constantly evolving and wide variaty of widgets available 
          in Experience Builder empowers the integration and visualization of point, line, polygon, and 3D multipatch data 
          in an interactive and harmonious manner, allowing users to explore an area through simple navigation of tradition 
          2D maps and closer-to-reality 3D scenes.
        </p>

        <h3>Featured function 1: Near Me widget - Locating nearby features and the closest feature of a location</h3>
        <p>The Near Me widget is the ideal solution to the shortcoming of ordinary online map application - if we want to 
        search for schools in an area, we type in school in the search bar, and the application will display the search results 
        within your current map extent. However, this is not good enough for someone who wish to explore the surround neighborhood 
        when they are doing house-hunting.</p>

        <p>By setting the analysis type as proximity, the Near Me widget finds and analyzes all public amenities within a specified 
        distance of a defind location. In comparison, by setting the analysis type as closest feature, the Near Me widget finds 
        and analyzes the closest public amenities within a specified distance of a defind location. This leads to the development 
        of the two tools in the 2D Exploerer - Around Me and Closest to Me respecively.</p>

        <h4>Demonstration of Around Me</h4>
	<img src="assets/gif" alt="2D Explorer - Around Me">
	      
        <h4>Demonstration of Closest to Me</h4>
	<img src="assets/gif" alt="2D Explorer - Closest to Me">

        <h3>Featured function 2: Synchronized 2D & 3D Visualization + 3D Analysis</h3>
	<p>In the 3D Explorer application, the 2D map and the 3D map operate in paralle - when the users zoom in, pan, or search for 
	locations in one, the other map is triggered and zoom to the same map extent. This provides users with a greater flexibility 
	in exploring both the planar position as well as the simulated stereoscopic environment of the locations. This could be a 
	particularly useful function to explore features that is only available in an three dimensional environment, such as building 
	height, building density, skyline, etc.</p>
	      
	<img src="assets/gif/" alt="3D Explorer">

	<p>The daylight and shadow cast effects in the 3D Toolbox are valuable tools to analyze the sunshine conditions in a location at 
	different time in a day, in addition to on different day within a year. The line of sight tool also enables the exploration of 
	unobstructed views from a location. These collectively allow users to look for a location with a desirable amount and angle of 
	sunlight, and views.</p>

	<p>The fly controller provides an immersive experience to visualize the 3D surrounding environment around a point location or along
	a path.</p>

	<h3>Featured function 3: Embedding external resources</h3>
	<p>The Embed widget open the door for additional custom functinalities via a URL or code. The highly configurable structure of 
	Experience Builder on the one hand facilitate a swift web development with customizable tools, but on the other hand limit the 
	functionalities and possibilities of ordinary web development, such as via ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. With the Embed widget, 
	developers can develope web pages and other appplications on other platforms, and embed the relevant URL or simple code into the 
	web experience. In traditional web development environment, the embedment is achieved by iframe. In Experience Builder, it only costs 
	several clicks.</p>

	<p>In the final product, the content in the Crime Explorer and Statistics pages are developed using ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript and 
	ArcGIS Dashboard respectively, and they are embedded into the web experience.</p>

        <h3>Bugs? Purposeful design?</h3>
	Several bugs are encountered in some of the widgets in the web experience. 
	      
        <h4>Near Me widget not working as expected when features are out of reach</h4>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<img src="assets/gif/" alt="3D Explorer">

        <h4>Fly Controller widget</h4>

        <h3>What we like</h3>

        <h4>Near-codeless web development</h4>
        <p>Very intuitive to design a web experience. Does not require any programming knowledge or skill. </p>

        <h4>Enrich web experience with Embed widget</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h3>What we think can be improved</h3>

        <h4>Configurable widgets, but with very few options</h4>
        <p>Particularly in widget and style</p>

        <h4>Capable of performing spatial analysis, only if we pay</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h4>The lone ranger</h4>
        <p>Not open for collaboration</p>

        <h4>Codeless = Difficult to debug</h4>
        <p>Luckily did not encounter many bugs</p>

        <h3>Missteps made</h3>
        <h4>Reliance on online data</h4>
        <h4>Triggering more than one Near Me widget at the same time</h4>
        <h4>Query</h4>

        <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

        <h4>Perform symbolization and other map settings in ArcGIS Pro or AGOL before importing into Experience Builder</h4>

        

        <h4>Hardware for 3D</h4>

        <h4>Read documentation and tutorials to know the widgets</h4>
