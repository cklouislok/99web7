        <h3>
          Abstract
        </h3>
        <p>
          Using ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript 4.29 and adapting their sample codes, created a web
          application for exploring Toronto Neighborhood Crime Statistics.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Main function 1: Query statistics by geometry
        </h3>
        <p>
          The neighborhood crime statistics are queried by year and crime type among neighborhoods intersecting a buffer, and displayed in a bar chart. 
          The user can drag the center point of the buffer or resize the buffer by dragging the edge point. This function 
	  largely fulfils the specification of a proposal deliverable in allowing users to define the location and area of 
     	  a circle to explore relevant crime statistics.
        </p>

          <h3>
          Main function 2: Option to define custom class breaks for each crime type
          </h3>
          <p>
            By reading the same neighborhood crime statistics, a class breaks renderer is generated 
            using the Feature Layer and the fields of crime types. By clicking the expandable widget, the user can
	    customize the class breaks by selecting the type of crime, the classification method, and the number of 
	    breaks. If manual classification method is chosen, the user can specify the cut-off points for each class.
          </p>

        <h3>
          Other functions
          </h3>
          <p>
            Other functions combined offer common functionalities of web maps. They include a number of widgets:
	    the search bar that allows the user to navigate to any location within Toronto, an option to switch the base map, north arrow button 
	    to readjust the orientation of the map, a home button to return to the initial map extent, and a full screen 
	    button. Particularly, the widgets for the main functions and also legend can be expanded and collapsed for
	    better user experience and clean presentation.
          </p>
        
        <h3>
          Tips and tricks for configuring a solution involving SDK
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Understanding codes:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> You do not have to understand every single part of the sample code to make things work; if the sample or the desired result is simple, it can be as easy as changing the data source from an example</li>
          <li> When trying to understand how a code sample works, search where the function or variable appears and works in the code</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          Working with codes:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Sometimes it is better to only make one change at a time to easily identify the issue</li>
          <li> Always be wary of the indentation and sequence of the codes, especially when you combine code examples/handle huge blocks of codes </li>
          <li> Considering time constraints, when adapting sample codes, try to stick to the sample or make as few necessary changes as possible to minimize chances of breaking things</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Concepts Learnt
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> The major processes in getting SDK to work share similarity with the ETL framework:
            to extract the desired data from the source, which is the neighborhood crime statistics 
            in our case (using ArcGIS REST Endpoint URL); to transform the data into a format that 
            can be loaded for display, which is summing up the crime statistics by type and year; lastly
            to load the data to the display, which is the bar chart structure in our case.

        <h3>
          Future Possibilities to Improve
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            Add in more data layers, ideally show everything in a single map
          </li>
	  <li> 
            Improve the user interface: configure action and panel components (e.g. with Calcite Design System) 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Technical challenges
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            Targeting/modifying the right parts of the code to fix things or make things work
          </li>
          <li> 
            A fix for a certain issue may lead to another issue
          </li>
	  <li> 
            Understanding/Dissecting how the sample works
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Mistakes Made
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            Not targeting the right code
          </li>
          <li> 
            Being too aggressive: making too many changes at once/trying to add significant
            amount of codes for adding a certain feature; that bounds to fail (unless you
            are really good with coding)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Project Missteps
        </h3>
        <p>
          A lot of them. Some examples below.
